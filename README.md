###### Random scripts I made that are mildly useful

#### timelapse.sh:
This script takes all photos in a directory and turns them into a timelapse. The script must be outside of the images directory and the directory must only have the images you want to timelapse in it. An example directory tree is as follows
```           
              .
              ├── timelapse.sh
              ├── orig

``` 
The Script requires ffmpeg to work.
